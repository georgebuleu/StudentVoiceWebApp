# StudentVoiceWebApp

To make Student Voice, we utilized a blend of technologies to bring it to life. Here's a quick rundown of the techy stuff:

ASP.NET: We used ASP.NET for the backbone of our platform. It's like the framework that holds everything together, from user registration to data management.

Entity Framework: This is our go-to tool for handling the database. It helps us store and retrieve all your class and feedback data efficiently.

MySQL: Behind the scenes, MySQL is where we store all the important information. It's like our digital filing cabinet, keeping track of your classes and reviews.

Angular: For the front-end, we went with Angular. It's the part you see and interact with - your dashboard, class lists, and the feedback forms.

How does it all work, you ask? Well, it's quite straightforward. You create an account, log in, and voila! Your personalized dashboard appears, listing all your classes. When you're feeling chatty or opinionated, you can leave reviews for your classes and professors. We keep these reviews safe in our MySQL database for others to see.
